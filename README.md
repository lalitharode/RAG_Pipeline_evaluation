Evaluation metrics for **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems assess the quality of both the retrieval and generation components. Here's a breakdown of the key metrics used for evaluating RAG systems:

---

### 1. **Retrieval Metrics**
These evaluate the performance of the retriever in fetching relevant documents from the knowledge base.

#### a. **Precision**
- Measures the proportion of retrieved documents that are relevant.
- Formula:  
  
  Precision = {Number of Relevant Retrieved Documents}/{Total Number of Retrieved Documents}
  

#### b. **Recall**
- Measures the proportion of relevant documents that are retrieved out of all relevant documents.
- Formula:  
  
  Recall = {Number of Relevant Retrieved Documents}/{Total Number of Relevant Documents in the Dataset}
  

#### c. **F1-Score**
- The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- Formula:  
  
  F1 = 2 *{{Precision} *{Recall}}/{{Precision} + {Recall}}
  

#### d. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**
- Evaluates the ranking quality of the retriever by checking the position of the first relevant document in the ranked results.
- Formula:  
  
  {MRR} = {1}{|Q|} +{i=1}^{|Q|} /{1}{{Rank of First Relevant Document in Query } i}
  

#### e. **Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG)**
- Evaluates ranking quality by considering the relevance scores and positions of retrieved documents.

#### f. **Coverage**
- Measures whether all relevant documents are covered in the retrieved set.

### 2. **Generation Metrics**
These assess the quality of the responses generated by the language model.

#### a. **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score)**
- Measures the overlap between generated and reference text.
- Commonly used for machine translation but applicable to text generation.

#### b. **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**
- Measures the overlap between the generated text and the reference text based on:
  - **ROUGE-1**: Overlap of unigrams.
  - **ROUGE-2**: Overlap of bigrams.
  - **ROUGE-L**: Longest common subsequence.

#### c. **Perplexity**
- Evaluates the fluency of the generated text by measuring how well the model predicts the next word.

#### d. **Answer Similarity**
- Measures semantic similarity between the generated answer and the reference answer, often using:
  - **Cosine Similarity**
  - **Sentence Transformers**
  - **Embedding Similarity** (e.g., using tools like `Sentence-BERT`).

#### e. **Toxicity**
- Measures whether the generated response contains offensive or toxic content.
  - Tools: Perspective API, OpenAI's moderation endpoint.

### 3. **Hallucination Metrics**
These assess whether the generated response contains false or unsupported information.

#### a. **Hallucination Rate**
- Measures the percentage of generated content that is factually incorrect or not grounded in the retrieved documents.

#### b. **Attribution Score**
- Evaluates whether the generated response can be traced back to the retrieved documents.

#### c. **Grounding Percentage**
- Measures the proportion of generated content that directly uses retrieved information.

#### d. **Confidence Score**
- A score representing the likelihood that the response is factually accurate.

---

### 4. **End-to-End Metrics**
These combine the evaluation of retrieval and generation components.

#### a. **Answer Accuracy**
- Measures whether the final answer aligns with a ground truth answer.

#### b. **Query Success Rate**
- The percentage of queries for which the RAG system provides a correct response.

#### c. **Human Evaluation**
- Human judges evaluate the responses on:
  - **Relevance**
  - **Fluency**
  - **Completeness**
  - **Conciseness**

### Tools and Frameworks for RAG Evaluation
1. **Hugging Face Evaluation Metrics** (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE).
2. **Google's Perspective API** (for toxicity detection).
3. **MLFlow Custom Metrics**.
4. **LangChain** for pipeline integration.

These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the system's performance, helping to identify weak spots and improve the RAG pipeline.
